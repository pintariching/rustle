# rustle
The Svelte compiler, rewritten in Rust.

## Reasons
My main reason for doing this, is to compile `Svelte` without `Node.js` and possibly use `Deno` instead.

### Work in progress
This is still a big work in progress. I'm mainly working on this for fun and learning.
I came up with the name rustle by combining **rus**t and sve**lte** (ruslte => rustle). The project is open to naming suggestions!
