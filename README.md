# Rustle

A Svelte-like compiler, written in rust.

## Work in progress

# Getting started

### Installation

To install with cargo, run `cargo install rustle_cli` to install the CLI.

### Using rustle_cli

<!-- Run `rustle_cli app.rustle` to generate an `app.js` file. You can optionally specify a different output file with the `-o` flag.

You can also specify a directory for example `rustle_cli src` to parse all the files in that directory.

For debugging, you can print the generated AST with the `-a` or `--ast` flag and pretty print it with `-p`. -->
